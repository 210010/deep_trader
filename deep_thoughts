I am starting this file in middle of project because to keep track of why I am making changes and also I am working alone so this is more of also a friend to me for brain storming. Let's start:
a) The current problem with the project is that I can see deep_trader improving the reward function based on how average reward is increasing on test data. But that means nothing to me now because its very hard to see what decision deep_trader is making from standardized data. Currently I am thinking to implement a code which actually shows decision per episode and that too with real price. This will help me analyze episode in much better way. Let's get started on it and I don't feel version 0 of this will be difficult to implement.
